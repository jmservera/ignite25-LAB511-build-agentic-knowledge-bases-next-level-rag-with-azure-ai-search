    "# LAB511: Build Agentic Knowledge Bases - Next Level RAG with Azure AI Search\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab demonstrates Azure AI Search's agentic retrieval capabilities through 8 hands-on notebook exercises. You'll work with Knowledge Bases that connect chat models to multiple data sources and use intelligent agents to decompose queries, retrieve relevant content, and synthesize grounded answers with citations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary><b>🤖 What is Agentic RAG?</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional RAG, agentic retrieval analyzes conversation context to understand user intent, decomposes complex queries into focused subqueries, and executes searches concurrently across multiple sources. It ranks and filters results using semantic understanding, then synthesizes answers with citations back to source documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary><b>🧠 What is a Knowledge Base?</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "In Azure AI Search, a **knowledge base** is a top-level resource that connects a chat completion model to one or more **knowledge sources** (searchable indexes or remote data sources). It defines which data sources to query, which model to use for reasoning, and how query execution should be optimized. Once created, you can update it at any time.\n",

    "## Lab Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary>📚 This lab contains 8 notebooks, each focusing on a specific knowledge base configuration or optimization pattern. Extend to learn more!</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part 1: Basic Knowledge Base**: Create a knowledge source, configure a knowledge base with Azure OpenAI, and run queries with citation-backed answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part 2: Multiple Knowledge Sources**: Query multiple indexes. Use `always_query_source`, `retrieval_instructions`, and `answer_instructions` for control.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part 3: SharePoint Knowledge Source**: Connect to SharePoint documents with `RemoteSharePointKnowledgeSource` for real-time querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part 4: Web Knowledge Source**: Query public web URLs with `WebKnowledgeSource`. Combine internal and external content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part 5: Blob Knowledge Source**: Upload from Azure Blob Storage. Compare minimal (fast) vs. standard (semantic) indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part 6: Combined Knowledge Sources**: Query search indexes, web URLs, and SharePoint simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part 7: Minimal Reasoning**: Use `KnowledgeRetrievalMinimalReasoningEffort` to optimize for speed and cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part 8: Medium Reasoning**: Use `KnowledgeRetrievalMediumReasoningEffort` for balanced query decomposition.\n",

    "## Pre-configured Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab uses the following Azure resources, already set up for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Azure AI Search**\n",
    "  - `hrdocs` index: HR policies, handbook, company info\n",
    "  - `healthdocs` index: health benefits, insurance, coverage\n",
    "  - Semantic ranking enabled, pre-computed embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Azure OpenAI**\n",
    "  - `gpt-4.1`: Chat completion for reasoning and synthesis\n",
    "  - `text-embedding-3-large`: Embedding model for vector search\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Azure Storage & Services**\n",
    "  - Blob Storage, Azure AI Services, SharePoint access\n",
    "\n",
    "All documents are already indexed and vectorized. You'll focus on the agentic retrieval APIs, not data preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **📌 Tips** \n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Start with Part 1 to understand core concepts, then continue with Parts 2-6 to explore different knowledge source types, and finally Parts 7-8 to optimize reasoning effort for performance.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Each notebook is self-contained, you can run them independently or in sequence.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - ‼️ **Read the outputs**. Activity logs show how agentic retrieval works under the hood.\n",
