      "      \"snippet\": \"PLAN INFORMATION \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus is a comprehensive health plan that offers coverage for medical, \\n\\nvision, and dental services. It also provides coverage for prescription drugs, mental health \\n\\nand substance abuse services, and preventive care. You can choose from a variety of in- \\n\\nnetwork providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and \\n\\npharmacies. Emergency services are also covered, both in-network and out-of-network. \\n\\nCo-pays, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums may apply to your plan. Your plan may \\n\\nalso include separate deductibles for different services, such as prescription drugs and \\n\\nhospitalization. It is important to know what your plan covers and what the cost-sharing \\n\\nrequirements are. To get more information, please visit the Northwind Health website or \\n\\ncontact them directly. \\n\\nIt is also important to remember that there may be certain exceptions or limitations in the \\n\\nplan. For instance, some plans may not cover certain types of services, such as cosmetic \\n\\nprocedures, or they may have limits on the number of visits to a provider that are covered. \\n\\nIt is important to read through your plan to understand what is and isn\\u2019t covered. \\n\\nWhen you are using your Northwind Health Plus plan, there are a few tips to keep in mind. \\n\\nFirst, remember to bring your Northwind Health Plus ID card with you when you go to the \\n\\ndoctor or pharmacy. This will help the provider verify your coverage and process your \\n\\nclaims. Second, if you are prescribed a medication, check to make sure it is covered by your \\n\\nplan. You may be able to save money by using a generic version of the drug or by using a \\n\\nmail-order pharmacy. \\n\\nFinally, if you are seeing an out-of-network provider, remember that you may be \\n\\nresponsible for paying more out-of-pocket costs than you would for an in-network provider. \\n\\nMake sure to check with the provider to get an estimate of what your costs will be.\"\n",
